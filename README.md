# The Online Markdown Previewer

## Project Description
The Online Markdown Previewer allows a user to write their markdown & generates an instant preview of that markdown within a previewer window. I developed it using React & a container component was used to initialize the app with sample markdown containing all the markdown possibilities/features available to the markdown writer for ease-of-use. The app's main conversion functionality was achieved using a parser & compiler from the [Marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) library to convert the markdown into HTML elements returned as a string to then be converted into actual HTML elements displayable within the app's previewer using the [ReactHTMLparser](https://github.com/wrakky/react-html-parser). The layout of the previewer was made responsive & represented accordingly using the popular React Bootstrap UI framework's form, card & badges components. In addition, CSS was used to further style & finalize the functionality of the layout required for the proper preview & indentation of bold or italicized text, tables, code snippets & block quotes.
